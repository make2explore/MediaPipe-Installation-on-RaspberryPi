## How to Install MediaPipe framework on a Raspberry Pi  
  
MediaPipe is a versatile open-source framework by Google, ideal for building machine learning pipelines for tasks like hand tracking, face detection, and pose estimation. Installing it on a Raspberry Pi can be a great way to leverage its capabilities for real-time computer vision projects on a compact, low-power device. This guide walks you through the steps to set up MediaPipe on a Raspberry Pi running a compatible operating system, such as Raspberry Pi OS (based on Debian).  
  
# Prerequisites
  
Before you begin, ensure you have:  
- A Raspberry Pi (preferably 4 or 400 for better performance) with Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit or 64-bit) installed.  
- An active internet connection.  
- A terminal or SSH access to your Raspberry Pi.  
- At least 10GB of free storage (preferably on a microSD card or external drive).  
- A USB webcam or Raspberry Pi Camera Module (optional, for testing MediaPipe applications).
